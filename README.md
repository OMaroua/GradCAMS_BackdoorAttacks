# GradCAMS_BackdoorAttacks
In this project,I focus on poisoning-based backdoor attacks, where the training dataset is manipulated to implant triggers. Through this, I investigate the behavior of backdoored models, analyze their susceptibility to triggers, and evaluate Grad-CAM visualizations to understand how the modelâ€™s decision-making process is affected.
